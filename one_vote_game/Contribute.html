{{ block content }}


<p>
    You have tried {{ player.num_trials }} puzzles, successfully solved {{ player.num_correct }},
    and failed {{ player.num_failed }}.
</p>
       <p>
        Your income through real effort tasks this round is {{ player.real_effort_income }}
    </p>

    <p>
        Now you need to report your pre-tax income in the following blank.
        You could misreport your income. After collecting the tax with
        rate {{ Constants.tax_rate }}, we will redistribute the payoff within a
        {{ Constants.players_per_group }}-player group, with an efficiency factor of
        {{ Constants.redistribution_multiplier }}.
    </p>
    <p>
    Please note, there is
        {{ group.audit_weight }}
        possibility to be audited. Once you report a lower income
        and are discovered by the auditor, you will receive a punishment with {{ Constants.penalty_multiplier }} for every dollar
        you should have paid.
